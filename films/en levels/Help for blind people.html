    <h3>Help for blind people – level 1</h3>
    <p>
        Some people are <b>blind</b>. Blind people can’t see well or at all. They can’t cross the street easily. They
        don’t
        hear bikes and electric cars.

        <b>Mael Fabien</b> watches these people. He wants to help them. He thinks that robots can help.

        Fabien gets an idea. He thinks about <b>autonomous</b> cars and how they work. Autonomous cars drive without a
        driver.
        The cars see <b>obstacles</b>.

        Fabien and other people make a special device. A person wears it around his neck. The device checks if obstacles
        are there. The device makes a noise to show the obstacles. A blind person knows where the things are.

        People can buy the device in September 2022. It’ll cost $3,150

    <h3>Help for blind people – level 2</h3>
    <p>
        A <b>Swiss</b> company developed a device which helps people who are partly or completely blind.

        One of the company founders and CEO is named Mael Fabien. He got the idea about the device when he saw that some
        people couldn’t easily cross the street when bikes or electric cars passed them. They couldn’t hear them well.

        Fabien thought about robots which could already solve these problems. He wanted to use similar technology to
        autonomous cars. Then the idea was born to make the device.

        The device sends sounds to the user and when an obstacle is in the way, the sounds get louder. People can buy
        this device in September this year, and it’ll cost $3,150.

    <h3>Help for blind people – level 3</h3>
    <p>
        A Swiss-based <b>startup</b> has developed a smart <b>harness</b> that supports the visually <b>impaired</b>
        with
        navigation.
        The
        device is called <b>Biped</b> One, and it uses the same technology for autonomous cars.

        It guides <b>pedestrians</b> with 3D sounds that become louder near obstacles. The sounds play into a
        pedestrian’s
        <b>headphones</b> as he moves. The device finds obstacles, cars, pedestrian crossings, and depending on the
        situation,
        it keeps important information.

        The company’s <b>co-founder</b> and CEO said that he saw many visually impaired people who couldn’t easily cross
        the
        street if bikes or electric cars passed them. He thought about how some robots could already do this task, and
        then he developed his project. Biped One goes on sale in September 2022, and it’ll cost $3,150.
