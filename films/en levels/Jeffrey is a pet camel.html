    <h3>TJeffrey is a pet camel – level 2</h3>
    <p>
        A man from England has a very special friend. It is not a man and not a dog. It is an 11 foot (3.4 metres) tall
        camel. His name is Jeffrey.

        Jeffrey is originally from Russia. He can survive temperatures of around minus 25 degrees Celsius. Jeffrey is
        the kind of a camel with two humps, and he can live until the age of around 60. He arrived in the UK from
        <b>Holland</b> seven years ago. He was originally a birthday gift for the man’s son.

        The man brings the camel <b>treats</b>. It is usually carrots, but the camel gets something extra special
        sometimes.
        Beer! The camel loves it. He drinks more than his owner!

        Difficult words: hump (raised part on the back of a camel), treat (food which is good), owner (person who has
        something).

    <h3>TJeffrey is a pet camel – level 3</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Simon Grant</b> from North <b>Yorkshire</b> has a very special friend. It’s not an old school <b>mate</b>,
        not even
        a dog –
        no,
        it’s an 11 foot camel called Jeffrey.

        Jeffrey is originally from Russia and is thought to be the UK’s only pet camel. He arrived in the country from
        Holland seven years ago and was originally brought over as a birthday present for Simon’s son Tom.

        “C’mon then! Come on, Jeff. That a fella. Who’s a big <b>fella</b>?”

        Simon brings treats most days, usually carrots, but once or twice a week, he gets something extra special –
        beer! Yes, you heard right, beer! So where did the idea come from?

        “Well, I was talking to a camel expert, and he said they just love beer. You know, so I thought, well why not
        try it? Let’s give it a go. He loves it. He can’t get enough of it. He drinks more than me.”

        Jeffrey is a <b>Bactrian</b> camel, <b>recognizable</b> by his twin humps, and he can survive in temperatures of
        around
        minus
        25 degrees Celsius. This <b>breed</b> of camel can live up until the age of around 60, so the Grants could have
        many
        more happy years ahead with their favourite pet. And if he does reach that <b>landmark</b> birthday, we know
        what
        <b>tipple</b> they’ll be toasting with.
