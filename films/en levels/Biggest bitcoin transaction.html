    <h3>Biggest bitcoin transaction – level 3</h3>
    <p>
        On the small <b>Indonesian</b> island of Bali, a big deal is going down, as a villa has been sold in what’s
        thought to
        be the largest Bitcoin transaction to date.

        The two bedroom, two bathroom property, complete with private pool, was bought by an anonymous buyer in Texas
        with less than 1,000 bitcoin, which is the <b>equivalent</b> to <b>roughly</b> 600,000 U.S. dollars.

        “I can’t tell you the exact amount, but it’s just short of 1000 bitcoins, which depending on the exchange rate,
        translates into about 600,000 U.S. dollars.”

        Despite the digital currency not being regulated or accepted as legal tender, the deal was sealed in late
        February through BitPremier which is an <b>exclusive</b> bitcoin trading website for <b>luxury</b> goods.

        “We’ve been referred to it by a family member, who has been dealing with bitcoins for the last two to three
        years so we thought we give it a try and see what happens. And that worked out to be pretty, pretty good for us.
        And you know, I know that it’s not a legal currency, I don’t really know if it ever will be, but I think the
        thing that has to happen right now is that the various governments, including the government of Indonesia, put
        the <b>regulation</b> in place and decide how they want to deal with this currency or this <b>phenomenon</b>.”

        The Indonesian Central Bank said the villa sale did not violate its law, as it was done in U.S. dollars.
