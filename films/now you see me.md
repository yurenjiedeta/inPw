573

带上那顶魔术头盔
put on the magical helmet...

574

听我说
Listen to me.

575

就算你没有抢银行 你也是知情者

578

什么
What?

No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't know each other well, if at all.

587

但是 就像这屋里却有一种微妙的紧张感

589

你应该考虑这个事实她有很多大秘密

591

这是你第一次外勤任务  对么

593

对于你来说是个奇怪的方式

594

你简直是在央求被捕.你知道么
You are literally begging to be arrested. You know that?

595

前提是你真会这样做  但是你不会
If it means you would actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

596

因为你这么做了 那意味着你
Because if you did, it means that you,

597

还有FBI还有你的国际刑警的朋友
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

598

实际上会在某种程度上相信魔术
actually believe, at an institutional level, in magic.

599

一定会让媒体哗然的
The press would have a field day.

600

而且我们就比我们现在出名多了
And we'd be even more famous than we already are.

601

而你们这些家伙看起来
And you guys would look like idiots

602

比现在更像白痴
even more then you already are.

603

 不 不是你  是他 好吧？

604

用我们行话来说就是 你们说
You have, what we in the business, like to call,

605

袖子什么也没有
"nothing up your sleeve."

606

你明白的
And you know it.

607

别让他迷上你然后又甩了他
Don't draw him in and then dump him

608

因为抛弃对于他来说是一个很大的 “心理阴影”

609

妈妈

爸爸
Daddy.

611

你跟爸爸有很大问题

619

你知道谁把他们抓到这的么？
And you know who put them there?

620

现在坐在你面前的人
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

621

所以我警告你 我能保持我的决心的时间远比
So I warn you, I can maintain my resolve much longer

622

你能保持你那种傲慢态度长
than you can maintain that phony arrogance.

623

一旦你引以为豪的表情露出
And the instant that you even show

624

哪怕一丁点破绽
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

625

我都会穷追不舍
I'll be there.

626

我会一直都在
I will be all over you like...

627

就像依附在你身上？
Like white on rice?

628

对不起 那不公平
Sorry. That's unfair.

629

让我警告你
Let me warn you.

630

我要你听着
I want you to follow.

631

因为无论你认为你知道什么
Because no matter what you think you might know,

632

我们都会永远领先你一步
we will always be one step, three steps,

633

三步 七步
seven steps ahead of you.

634

并且当你认为你追上来时
And just when you think you're catching up,

635

那时我们已经在你身后了
that's when we'll be right behind you.

636

不管什么时候
And at no time will you be anywhere other than

637

你只会被我牵着鼻子走
exactly where I want you to be.

638

所以尽管靠近点 放马过来
So come close. Get all over me

639

因为你觉得自己越接近
because the closer you think you are,

640

你看到的越少
the less you'll actually see.

641

我要抓住你
I'm gonna nail you...

642

那瓶苏打是不是有什么问题，小姐？
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

643

哦！ 次奥！
Oh! Shit!

644

魔术的第一守则
First rule of magic.

645

永远做房子里最聪明的人

646

老大 我们在做什么？ 我们就这样让他们走了？
Boss, what are we doing? We're letting them go?

647

他们都承认他们会再做一次
They all but admitted they're gonna do it again.

648

半小时前你对他们毫不在意
About a half an hour ago, you didn't give a damn about them.

671

681

你知道在这一时期我卖了多少DVD么
You know how many DVDs I sold in the same period?

682

500万
Five million.

683

好吧 那是因为钱
Right, so it's about the money.

684

钱只是一部分
Well, the money is only there

685

想获知真相的人远比乐意被蒙在鼓里的人多
because the need to know is greater than the desire to be fooled.

686

就像你 我恨那些就会欺骗无知观众的钱的人
Like you, I detest those who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

687

恕我直言 这场游戏中没有代价么
With all due respect, isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

688

698

被丢到河里

但是他再没有浮上来
But he never resurfaced.

700

701

我没害死他

702

他的死是因为他挑战了他不能运用自如的魔术

704

711

在拉斯维加斯的舞台是怎么打劫巴黎的银行
how a bank in Paris was robbed from a stage in Las Vegas,

712

我下个月会出专题节目

713

或者我可以指控你妨碍公务
Or I could just bring you in

714

或者强迫你告诉我
on obstruction charges and force you to tell me.

715

除非 当然 你想告诉我
Unless, of course, what you're trying to say to me is that

716

其实你也不知道他们怎么做的
you actually don't know how they did it.

717

表演技巧和舞台效果
Showmanship and theatrics.

718

当一个魔术师挥舞着他的手然后说
When a magician waves his hand and says,

719

这是魔术开始的地方

720

真正的魔术在别的地方开始

721

错误引导 最基本的魔术概念

722

对魔术的概念没兴趣

我只想知道他们怎么抢银行的

724

如果你认为他们抢了银行那你就是一个笨蛋
You're an idiot if you think they robbed a bank.

725

726

去巴黎旅游一趟如何？

729

731

过来吧

当你准备好了去巴黎

736

随便说个魔术咒语
just say the magic word.

737

去我的？
Blow me?

738

- That'll suffice. - Bon voyage.

739

你好（法语）
Bonjour.

740

我个人选择从楼梯去巴黎
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

741

欢迎来到光之城 Rhodes探员
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

742

呵呵 那你要我戴头盔干嘛
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

743

恶搞
My fun.

744

什么
What?

745

没什么
Nothing.

746

所以他们造了个仓库
So they got a vault set.

747

是的
Yes.

748

而且完全复制了
And it's the exact replica

749

那个小法国佬的银行
of the little French guy's bank.

750

所以他是个托
So he's a plant.

751

他是棋子，不是托
He was a dupe, not a plant.

752

他们选择了他  他们知道他坐在哪
They chose him. They knew which seat he was in.

753

不 不 不 观众选的座位
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

754

除非 当然  不是观众选择的位置
Unless, of course, the audience didn't pick the seat.

755

他们让观众觉得他们选了位置
They let them think they picked the seat.

756

我们会随机选择一位
We'll choose one at random then.

757

实际上 他们把事先准备好的球
Actually, they were just palming the ball

758

藏在掌心用来替换
with the seat number they wanted.

759

我们在找第5排
We are looking at row number 5.

760

Henley 能告诉我座位号吗？
Henley, could I please have a seat number?

761

幸运号码13
Lucky number 13.

762

你能确认一下这个是你的座位号吗
Could you just confirm that this is, in fact, your seat?

763

他是被选中的
He was selected.

764

他们给他暗示让他去拉斯维加斯
They programmed his mind to make him go to Las Vegas.

765

拉斯维加斯万岁
Viva Las Vegas.

766

然后他们不断强化催眠 直到他做到了
And then they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

767

他们跟踪他
They trailed him.

768

研究他
They studied him.

769

这一切都不是靠运气
Nothing was left to chance.

770

我有他的资料了
I got his measurements.

771

他不知道他是他们的目标
He had no idea he was their target.

772

他们只要想把他在拉斯维加斯激活就好了
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

773

当我打响指
When I snap my fingers...

774

再一次 梅里特·麦金尼
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

775

但是他怎么知道他是哪个银行的
But how did they know what bank was his?

776

- 你在开玩笑 - 真的么
- You're kidding. - Really?

777

你能再蠢点么？
Can you be any more of a condescending ass?

778

是的
Yes.

779

就像这样
Like this.

780

魔术师有一个非常罕见的 很神秘的方式
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

781

去占卜一名观众的银行
in which a magician divines an audience member's bank.

782

你准备好了么？
You ready?

783

是的
Yes.

784

信用卡
Credit card.

785

那就是他们如何拿到牌上的签名
And that's how they got the signature for the card

786

然后留在了巴黎的金库里面
they left in the vault in Paris.

787

很好
Very good.

788

你被人领先了 Rhodes探员
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

789

好了 但是他们还得把签了名的牌放进金库里啊
Okay, but they had to get the signature card in the vault.

790

你刚才说他们没有偷那些钱
You said they didn't steal the money.

791

不 我并没有这样说
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

792

我说他们没有抢劫银行
I said they didn't rob the bank.

793

我猜测他们的盯上
My guess is that they targeted

794

运钞车上的一批刚印出来的钱
a shipment of freshly minted money

795

送往那个法国人的银行的钞票
headed to the Frenchman's bank on-board an armored truck.

796

当然 也很难进去
Which, of course, is just as hard to break into.

797

除非你已经在里面了
Unless you're already inside.

798

尽管银行不会承认
And despite what the banks would have you believe,

799

开这些卡车的人都不是精神强大的人
the men who drive these trucks are not exactly mental giants.

800

对于我们的骑士
For our Horsemen,

801

太容易搞定了
it was almost too easy.

802

嘿 伙计们
Hey, boys.

803

那怎么让假钱从金库消失的？ 那是什么？
So, how did they make the fake money disappear from the vault? What is that?

804

闪光纸（特殊加工纸，燃烧不留灰不引燃其他易燃物）
Flash paper.

805

魔术师经常使用它们
Magicians use it all the time.

806

不产生烟 不留灰烬
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

807

两天前 没有人听说过这些家伙
Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

808

但是今晚他们表演的门票在35秒内便被抢购一空
but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

809

我想他们已经向世人解释了表演的真谛
I think these guys have cracked the secret to show business.

810

那就是给你的观众300万美元
Give your audience $3 million.

811

让他们有个好心情 对么？
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

812

有史以来最好的结局
Best finale ever.

813

他们会成为载入史册的第一批魔术师
They're gonna be the first magicians in history to get laid.

814

记住 如果氧气罩掉下来了（指飞机失事）
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

815

首先先给律师带上  记着哦 是的
put it on the lawyer first. Remember. - Oh, yes.

816

我总是这样做   律师优先
I always do. It's lawyer first,

817

- 然后是我自己然后是孩子 - 然后是你自己
-then myself and then the children. - Then yourself.

818

是的 然后是孩子
Yes. Then the children.

819

允许我来说说我们俩一直共同思考的问题吧
Allow me to make plain what we've both been thinking.

820

那是什么
And what's that?

821

很明显 你对丹尼尔有感觉
Well, obviously, you have feelings of affection for Daniel.

822

不求回报且一往情深
Unrequited and misguided,

823

因为他根本就是情感无能的
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

824

因此 你便十分的...
Consequently, you're very tightly...

825

怎么说呢
How should I put it?

826

憋屈
Corked.

827

哦 是吗？
Oh, I am？

828

现在 既然你的生理需求得不到满足
Now, recognizing that you have physical needs not being met,

829

本着友好互助的精神
and strictly in the vein of helping a sister out,

830

你可以考虑一下让我做你的私人备胎
I invite you to think of me as your own personal corkscrew.

831

哇哦 谢谢
Wow. Thanks.

832

让我仔细考虑那个廉价和没有意义的性建议
Let me mull over that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

833

也许廉价或者没有意义 但不是在浪费时间啊
Cheap and meaningless, maybe, but not time-consuming.

834

我们可能会提前几分钟抵达
We should be getting there a few minutes early.

835

所以坐回去 放松
So, sit back, relax.

836

我们即将抵达新奥尔良（别称是Big Easy）
We should be in the Big Easy soon.

837

再次感谢您乘坐本次航班
Appreciate you flying with us today.

838

那么 对 Tressler来说除了能得到钱还有什么
So, what's in it for Tressler, besides the money?

839

自尊心
Ego.

840

好吧 选一张牌
Okay, pick your card.

841

看一下 然后放在桌上 然后告诉我
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

842

不 别告诉我
No, don't tell me.

843

- 好的 - 好的
-Okay. -Okay.

844

Thaddeus那天晚上在那
Thaddeus was there that night.

845

他完全明白他们是怎么做到的  那他呢？
He knows exactly how they pulled it off. What about him?

846

你说什么呢？
What are you saying?

847

你认为他们可能是一伙的
You think they could be working together.

848

我不知道 我所知道的是这些家伙
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

849

都是街头魔术师
were a bunch of street magicians

850

一年前一无所有
a year ago with no resources.

851

那如果没有外界的某种帮助
So, how do they go from doing that to this

852

他们是如何从街头魔术师变成现在的名人呢？
without some kind of outside help?

853

是你的牌么
Is this your card?

854

不 我的牌在那个家伙身上
No, my card is sitting over there in that guy's lap.

855

洗牌技术不错
Nice shuffle.

856

857

根据这本书
According to this book,

858

一些人仅练习其中的一个简单动作就要每天练八小时，年复一年
some of those guys practice one simple move eight hours a day for years.

859

真的么  这帮人该找点正经事做了
Really? Some of those guys seriously need to get a life.

860

你是对所有魔术师都有意见么
Is it magicians, in general, you have a problem with?

861

还是只是对这几个人有意见
Or specifically those guys?

862

整体来说我对魔术师一点都不感冒
I could care less about magicians in general.

863

我只是讨厌那些利用别人的人
What I hate is people who exploit other people.

864

怎么利用他们了？
Exploit them how?

865

再试一次
Try again.

866

通过利用他们的弱点

867

利用其需求使其相信一些无法解释的事物
Their need to believe in something that's unexplainable

868

来忍受生活中的磨难
in order to make their lives more bearable.

869

我把它看作一种力量

870

当我相信它时 我的生活更快乐
My life is happier when I believe that.

871

Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

If it's such an easy thing, why don't you do Henley?

967

在树里面 封装在玻璃瓶中
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

968

970

我不知道 但是我确定有合理解释
I have no idea. But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

971

让一下
Excusez-moi

972

你们有人在那个大厅么？
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

973

不 但是我的确有些好消息

974

记住阿特拉斯是一个控制狂

975

他要整个成员都戴上可追踪的手镯

976

什么可追踪手镯？

他让他的每个成员

978

都戴上一个追踪手镯

979

这些手镯是8个频带的

990

他们把钥匙扔到塞纳河

991

- 整天都有人这么做母亲 情侣 老人
All day they do this. Mothers, lovers, old men.

992

看着钥匙沉到河里
Watching the key sink into the water

993

他们的秘密被永远地锁住

994

真实而又神奇
Real and, at the same time, magical.

995

那么
So,

996

你真的觉得有可能还会有第5位骑士么？

传说中古埃及曾有一个神秘团体

1000

称为“眼睛”
"The Eye."

1001

据说 其成员会苦练手上功夫
It is said they perfected sleight of hand

1002

从法老那里偷食物
to steal food from the Pharaohs

1003

然后分给奴隶
and give it to the slaves.

1004

他们的目的是什么？
Their purpose?

1005

使用魔术和错觉来平衡正义的天平
Using magic and illusion to even the scales of justice.

1006

这几位天启骑士们会否与一众蠢人相信这个神话呢？
Are The Horsemen next in a long line of fools to believe this myth?

1007

他们能逃脱法律和逻辑么 就像他们在拉斯维加斯做的
Will they evade the rules of law and logic like they did in Las Vegas?

1008

还是这片南部沼泽的暗黑秘术
Or will the dark mysticism of this Southern swampland

1009

比他们更好
get the better of them?

1010

很好 Bradley先生
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

1011

除非你有禁止令
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

1012

我猜你没有 否则你应该离开
which you don't, or you should leave.

1013

如果我想让什么停止

1014

它就停止

1019

我这里有张支票
I have here a check

1020

350万美元
for 3.5 million.

1021

让我走开么
To walk away?

1022

是飞走 我的私人飞机随时可供你调遣
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1023

我们不要再开玩笑了  Tressler先生
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1024

你是想把他们捧出名吧
You're in this to ride them up.

1025

而我就是要让他们名声扫地
I'm in it to ride them down.

1026

我觉得我们没什么可谈吧
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1027

这也是我们之间的矛盾
And therein lies our conflict.

1028

我直话直说
Let me be blunt.

1029

我银行账户里的钱你可不能比
My bank account is much, much bigger than yours.

1030

但是我的律师团队也更强大
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1031

他们会用各种各样的禁令
And they will manacle you

1032

让你寸步难行
with so many injunctions.

1033

直到你站在一边，无助的看着
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1034

你所拥有的一切
everything that you own drain away

1035

从你贪婪的小眼下飘过
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1036

这不是我第一次收到威胁了
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1037

可我还是好好地站在这
And I'm still here.

1038

不过 这可是你第一次被我威胁
It is, however, the first time you've been threatened by me.

1039

如果你敢搞砸我的投资
And if you do anything to sully my investment,

1040

如你所言，让他们声名扫地的话
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1041

会立刻 马上惹出严重的祸事
will be sudden, precipitous, and measurable on the Richter scale.

1042

你不应该这么做的
You shouldn't have done that.

1043

根据迷信说法
According to superstition,

1044

人使用娃娃发泄愤怒
one who uses a doll to enact one's own wrath,

1045

将给自己带来同样的愤怒
is likely to bring that very wrath unto himself.

1046

有趣吗
Isn't that funny?

1047

我还以为你不信魔术的
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1048

帮我个忙
Do me a favor.

1049

幻想一个你最刺激很性感的性体验
Visualize your most adventurous sexualexpe?ence.

1050

没门 你个变态
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1051

如果我不读你的思想  怎么能上你
Well, no, if I stay out of your head, I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1052

好吧 我们继续练习吧
- Right. - So let's stick with this exercise.

1053

这有利于...   原谅我的冒犯
- And it helps... - Pardon the intrusion.

1054

我希望晚上一切顺利
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1055

然后你可以在网上曝光我们吗
What, so you can try to expose us later on your little website?

1056

需求量可大了
And on demand.

1057

那是不可能的 - 是吗
- That's not gonna happen. - Oh, no?

1058

因为天眼而用一架特殊的飞机？
Operating on a special plane because of The Eye?

1059

听说那地方很不错 有月光、星光
I heard it's a lovely place. Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1060

实现任何魔术师的愿望
Make any magician's wish come true.

1061

你远道而来
You've come a long way,

1062

比不少无名小卒和过气明星
much further than anyone would have expected

1063

都要长
of a bunch of wanna-hes and has-beans.

1064

过气明星指的是我的话  那我受宠若惊了
If by "has-been" you're referring to me, I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1065

因为我总觉得自己是个无名小卒
because I always considered myself a never-was.

1066

介意我在你身上用一下读心术吗
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1067

当然可以
By all means.

1068

我在构想一个小男孩
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1069

他想成为一个伟大的魔术师
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1070

尽管他很棒，但还是不够好
And though he's good, he's not quite good enough.

1071

最后只能在娱乐圈的底层食物链苟且偷生
So he ends up at the bottom of the entertainment food chain,

1072

以他无法企及的天才吃剩的渣滓为食
feeding off of those who have the talent that he never did.

1073

告诉我 我说得对吗
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1074

等等 在你走之前，我正在研究一个新东西  你有时间吗
Wait. Before you go. I'm working on something new. Do you have a second?

1075

好吧 选一张牌
Okay. Name a card.

1076

红桃K - 知道了
- King of hearts. - Knew it.

1077

在你左边的袖子里  是吗
- It's up your left sleeve. - Is it?

1078

不 我没看到
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1079

你为什么不检查一下你那多余的口袋  就是那个
You know, why don't you check your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?  Yeah

1080

去你的
Suck it.

1081

无论如何 十分感谢您光临寒舍，但这里是非天才免进区域
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by, but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1082

祝君好运
Break a leg.

1083

祝你也断点什么
Hey, you break something, too.

当他才14岁

1098

他看见中心公园 有个树洞

1099

他让一名操作旋转木马的工作人员

1100

像寻常的把戏那样在牌上签名

1101

然后呢

18年后   在那家伙退休时
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1103

Shrike 表演了个节目 让那个人在扑克牌上签字

1106

1107

牌在树里

1108

这棵树裹卡牌长了18年 那可不是魔术 一点也不魔幻
The tree grew around the card in 18 years. I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1109

重点是 目光不能短浅
The point is, the trick was not to look closely.

1110

要长远考虑
It was to look so far

1111

要回溯20年去看
that you see 20 years into the past.

1112

Shrike溺水后  他们一直找不到他的尸体
After Shrike drowned, they never found the body.

1134

接下来进行的到底是100个不同的把戏

有个漂亮的法国妞突然出现

1391

如果能让你好过点

1392

我会说这与你无关

1393

那你告诉我为神马与我无关

1394

这只是魔术 Tressler
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1395

全球规模的

1396

而你 先生…你只是他们的abracadabra （魔咒，暗指 棋子）
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1397

是他们偷梁换柱时用来分散注意力的
The distraction, while they set up the real trick.

1398

用我1亿4千万来分散注意力？
I was a $140-million distraction?

1399

是的
Yes.

1400

那种非常自我使你第一时间融入他们
And that very ego that got you involved with them in the first place

1401

这让你看不到这一切
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1402

你知道  "我可以让你永远翻不了身"
- You know... -"I can destroy you."

1403

我知道
Yes, I do know.

1404

你不会的
Well, you won't.

1405

你也不会让他们不得翻身
And you won't destroy them.

1406

无论这大戏法是什么
Whatever this grand trick is,

1407

都是老早就设计好的
it was designed a long time ago.

1408

我相信接下来的才是真正令人惊叹的好戏
And I believe that what's about to follow is really going to amaze.

1409

所以我建议放松 好好享受你的前座
So I suggest you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1410

你可是为它花了好多钱

1411

无论你赚了多少

1412

我出两倍 如果你现在就能揭发他们

1413

摧毁他们

1414

我挣了500万
I stand to make five million.

1415

你看我退缩了吗

1421

Merritt告诉我 我几乎整天呆在办公室 他是对的
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent any time away from the desk, he was right.

1422

我是一个调查员 我最擅长那个
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1423

那这怎么回事
So what's this all about?

1424

据说  如果你相信的话
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1425

目行者是真正魔术
The Eye are the keepers

1426

的看守者
of real magic

1427

以及所有魔术师的保护神
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1428

候选人应该遵循
"Candidates for initiations

1429

必须谨记并绝对服从以下命令
"must follow a series of commands with blind obedience."

1430

荒诞不经 但还有很多人相信这个
- This isn't real. - But there are some who think it is.

1431

我来
May I?

1432

据这本书上所说  他们一个世纪才挑两次人
According to this, they only take new people twice a century.

1433

那又怎么样 那些魔术师做这些就是为了成为目行者一员
So what? The Horsemen are doing these shows in order to get into this thing?

1434

我不知道  我不知道  
- I don't know. - I don't know.

1435

我的意思是他们本可以直接抢银行
I mean, I guess these guys could just rob banks to rob banks.

1436

用不着表演
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1437

这可能只是神话
It's probably just a myth.

1438

但前后却说不通，而且我觉得这事不能按寻常逻辑思考
But it doesn't make any sense, and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1439

我现在也这么想了 - 没错
- You don't say? - No.

1440

我相信有些事情
Ibefieve that some things are only discovered

1441

只有离得足够远才能看清某些东西
if you take certain leaps.

1442

好了  我要    是啊
- Well, I gotta get to... - Yeah. Yeah.

1443

谢谢 晚安 - 嗯 晚安
- Thanks. Good night. - Yeah. Good night.

1444

不好意思 - 没关系
- Sorry. -It's all right.

1445

如果目行者存在 我们得假设他们正在看着我们 对吧
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume they were watching us, right?

1446

该死
Shit.

1447

我觉得有人在监视我们 但这不是魔术
I think someone is watching us, but it isn't magic.

1448

你的担心没错 这不是你的手机
Your fears are correct. This is not and has never been your phone.

1449

1465

放回去 开机

1467

他们还不知道我们已经发现了窃听器

1468

1593

今天 饱受褒奖和争议的魔术团体
Today, the unfolding story of a popular and controversial group of magicians,

1594

把唐人街的警方展开的缉拿行动
who have been fast capturing the public's imagination,

1595

变为一场在第59街大桥展开的
took a dark turn when a police action that began in Chinatown

1596

戏剧性高速追捕行动
developed into a dramatic, high-speed chase across the 59th Street Bridge,

1597

导致天启四骑士之一的Jack Wilder

1609

你知道魔术师助手的作用
You do understand the function

1610

对吧  Rhodes探长
of the magician's assistant, don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1611

当魔术师负责耍把戏时
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1612

助手来分散观众注意力
while he sets up the trick.

1613

你错的还不太算离谱
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1614

当你关注魔术师时
While you're watching the magician,

1615

那一脸无辜的小可爱却在操控一切
that lovely innocent is actually pulling the strings.

1616

难道你不觉得派个做文员的国际刑警
Don't you find it peculiar that Interpol would send you

1617

来当你的助手很奇怪吗
a first timer off the desk to be your assistant?

1618

为什么她会加入到这个案子来

1619

她被委派的
She was assigned to the case.

1620

抽到好牌了

1621

就像从牌堆里随机抽牌一样

1622

我觉得你突然间的好心更奇怪

1623

你在打什么小算盘

1624

我只是想让游戏更公平
Just trying to even the game.

1625

我觉得我是在和绑了沙袋 戴了脚蹼的人斗

1626

Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1627

我们有麻烦了

1628

1629

他在那干嘛

1630

给我们可靠的切入点
Giving us our first solid lead.

1631

我们在调查一个私人保安承包商
We've been investigating a private security contractor

1632

叫名Elkhorn
called Elkhorn

1633

在过去5年 肿么了
-for the last five years. - And?

1634

他们匿藏了将近5亿美金
They've been hiding close to a half billion dollars...

1635

我没问你 我问他
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1636

钱被放在皇后区的一个仓库的保险箱里

1637

我认为保险箱是魔术师的终极目标
We think this vault is your magicians' final target.

1638

桥上死的魔术师…
The magician who died on the bridge...

1639

你从他手里拿出的绝密文件正是Elkhorn公司的
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file right from his crispy little hand.

1640

除了那些像罗宾汉的花招
And despite their bullshit Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1641

那帮魔术师和普通盗贼没什么两样
your magicians are nothing more than common thieves.

1642

他们是怎么拿到文件的
How did they get the file?

1643

我保证这部分
This is the part you're gonna find

1644

才是你最感兴趣的 Rhodes探员
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1645

当他们在新奥尔良
They patched to my server after they accessed

1646

进入你手机的指挥中心后
your mobile command center in New Orleans

1647

从你那儿盗取了服务器的密码
with codes they got from your phone.

1648

你当时命令我们全部去追捕
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1649

你们在这个案子上所展现的无能程度
The level of incompetence displayed on this case,

1650

本身就是个魔术了
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1651

Abracadabra 我要接手这案子
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1652

老板 他接手？
Boss, he's taking over?

1653

我们走吧先生们
Let's go, gentlemen.

1654

我想和你谈谈
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1655

以后不要像个刚才那样和我说话
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1656

你究竟为什么要接这个案子 什么？
- Why the hell did you take this case? - What?

1657

美国人有句话“知人口面不知心”
People say I'm "hard to read." That's an American expression.

1658

你懂吗
Do you understand it?

1659

是的
Yes.

1660

那好 现在我就跟你讲清楚
Good, then let me make myself perfectly clear to you.

1661

如果我发现你除了做现在的工作外
If I find out that you are anything other than

1662

还搞些小动作的话  我发誓我会..
who you say you are, I swear...

1663

我们法国也有一句话
And we French also have an expression.

1664

信念可以移山
La foi soulève la montagne.

1665

即信任能战胜一切
"Faith can move mountains."

1666

如果我们想抓住魔术师
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1667

你就要对我有信任之心
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1668

因为我没做见不得人的事
Because I've done nothing to deserve otherwise.

1669

我刚刚就被人出卖了
I just got my ass handed to me.

1670

这个案子不归我管了
I am losing this case.

1671

现在信任这种奢侈我可享受不起
So faith is a luxury I don't have any time for right now.

1672

在他生命中，比任何东西更重要的是
More than anything in his life,

1673

Jack想成为史上最有名的魔术师
Jack wanted to be the most famous magician who ever lived.

1674

我无法说他实现了梦想
And I can't say he achieved it,

1675

但是我希望无论在哪 都充满魔术
but I do hope wherever he is, it is full of magic.

1676

关键是  抱歉
But the point is... Sorry.

1677

关键是
The point is...

1678

关键是我们之所以在这儿是想说我们现在不能放弃

We've started something bigger than all of us.

1680

1700

他们手下在装箱

Lionel Shrike生前排练的场地
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1752

也是我第一场表演的地方
It's where I did my first show.

1753

如果你还想接着出丑的话
Now, if you wanna look like even bigger idiots,

1754

就打开保险箱
why not open it?

1755

当你们这么做时 Rhodes探员
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1756

介不介意再做一次那种
would you mind reenacting your look

1757

无比困惑的表情吗

1770

又一次 误导

1771

表演马上要开始了  准备行动

1772

Rhodes探长 我想问的是
The question I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1773

真的保险箱到底在哪
"What happened to the real one?"

1774

让路 让他们让开
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1775

快让他们让开 别挡路
Come on. Move 'em out. Move 'em out of the way.

1776

FBI  给我们让开

1777

让开  让开
Clear out! Clear out!

1778

魔术是什么
What is magic?

1779

魔术是错觉

1780

但是错觉是为了给人带来快乐
But deception designed to delight,

1781

娱乐和灵感
to entertain, to inspire.

1782

当心 让开 让开 当心
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1783

魔术是一种信仰

1784

信念

信任
Trust.

1786

没有那些品质

1787

魔术作为一种艺术形式 将会名存实亡

1788

但是如果这些品质
But what happens if these qualities

1789

不是用于崇高理想
are not used for their higher purpose?

1790

而是用来欺骗、撒谎
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1791

为了一己私欲和欲壑难填的贪婪
For personal gain or for greed.

1792

这就不再是魔术了
Then it's no longer magic.

1793

而是犯罪
It's crime.

1794

所以今夜 为了我们的闭幕演出
So tonight, for our final act,

1795

你们要帮我们拨乱反正
you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1828

你丫的
Oh, you!

1829

天啊 一切结束后我们又何去何从

We're on our own.

1831

我们的得到的指示只写到这次表演结束
Our instructions run out after the show.

1832

即使没有目行者
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1833

即使我们被耍的团团转
if we were completely played and we spend

1834

还是要蹲20年的监狱
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1835

我只是想说…
I just want to say that...

1836

我知道 我也一样
I know. Me, too.

1837

我可吃不消你们这么煽情
Little too sentimental for me.

1838

1850

所以我们今晚的表演以
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1851

用告别来开场
By saying goodbye.

1852

我们想要的
All we wanted was to

1853

是向世界展示一场魔术表演

1854

也以此给世界带来一点魔力
And thereby bring a little magic

1855

Dylan Dylan Dylan
Dylan!Dylan!Dylan!

1869

你看看  这是什么
- You see that? - What?

1870

那真的钱在哪里啊
Where's the real money?

1871

你被捕了 手举起来
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1872

我被陷害了
I've been framed.

1873

我也觉得
I'm sure you were.

1874

我一贯可以
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1875

我真的可以
I always do.

1876

就像我一直预言你会干蠢事一样
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1877

我们就不要谈这些戏剧性的东西了
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1878

又不是在拍电影
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1879

伙伴们 我能单独跟这位朋友谈谈吗

1880

当然
Sure.

1881

好的
All right.

1882

我有信息可以提供给你
I got information to trade.

1883

然后就能放我走吧
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1884

除非物有所值
If it's of some value.

1885

牢狱生活给了一个人思考的时间
These bars give a man time to think.

1886

我确保我知道他们是怎么办的
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1887

还记得第二场里面的兔子魔术吗
Remember the rabbit trick in the second show?

1888

这盒子可不是空的
The box was never empty.

1889

房间也不是
The room wasn't either.

1890

进入仓库后
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1891

骑士们将真的保险箱留在原地
The Horsemen left the real safe

1892

把整个房间变成了大号兔子箱
and transformed the whole room

1893

巨大的兔子盒子
into a giant rabbit box.

1894

你们就这么冲进去
You go charging in there,

1895

以为保险箱早不见了
thinking the safe was already gone.

1896

又被耍了
Missing the trick. Again.

1897

让你误以为
Which was to make you think

1898

保险箱已经被偷了
the safe had already been stolen,

1899

所以你放松警惕就离开了
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1900

当你正在那儿忙着玩动物型气球
Now, while you were busy playing with balloon animals,

1901

有人闯入了仓库
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1902

谁
Who?

1903

Jack Wilder
Jack Wilder.

1904

天啊
Holy shit.

1905

怎么可能 他就死在我的眼皮底下

1906

除非 当然 他没死
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1907

门锁着的
It's locked.

1908

我不是说过吗
Weren't you listening?

1916

只需花几秒钟

1917

就可以让你跟丢
for you to lose contact with it

1918

然后进行调换
and make the switch.

1919

当你爬进去那部燃烧着的汽车
When you crawled into that burning car,

1920

你的举动特英勇 不得不说
quite heroically, I might add,

1921

你冒着生命危险去尝试
you almost died trying to rescue

1922

去救一具停尸房里的尸体
what I assume was a cadaver from the morgue.

1923

为什么要实施这么一处天衣无缝又危机四伏的计划
Why go through such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1924

就为了陷害一个人呢
just to frame one guy?

1925

我不明白
I don't know.

1926

他们从不拿所取之财

1928

但是我给了你更加实质性的重要信息
But I just gave you information that is substantially more important.

1929

不 其实没有 - 什么
- No. Not really. - What?

1930

我后来有机会好好调查一下Lionel Shrike
I finally got a chance to really look into Lionel Shrike.

1931

弄出他的复出意图和那次事故的缘由
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1932

我现在换种想法
So, here's my new theory.

1949

传说中的目行者无处不在
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1950

等待
Waiting

1951

真正伟大的魔术师将自己与平凡之辈
for the truly great magicians to distinguish themselves

1952

区分开来
from the mediocre ones.

1953

也许你就是其中一员
Maybe that was you.

1954

内心深处 你强烈渴望成为
Deep down inside you wanted nothing more

1955

想成为一名目行者 却从来被邀请
than to be part of the "Eye," but you were never invited.

1956

所以你企图摧毁他们 但是事与愿违
So you try to destroy them. But instead what happens?

1957

你惹毛了他们
You pissed them off.

1958

目行者不存在
The Eye isn't real.

1959

好 那你解释一下 谁在幕后指使
Okay, then, explain then. Who's behind all this?

1960

某个丧心病狂
Somebody with an obsession.

1961

拘泥小节的人 谁
- Meticulous. - Who?

1962

准备牺牲一切的人
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1963

如此孤注一掷以至于
Somebody so prepared to lose

1964

他在花招耍完之前都不会被怀疑
that they wouldn't even be a suspect until the trick was done.

1965

我不要模糊对象 我要名字 是谁
I don't want a profile. I need a name. Who? Who?

1966

我不知道
I don't know who.

1967

但是他们一定是进入仓库
But they had to have access to the warehouse

1968

安好镜子
to plant the mirrors.

1969

总是领先我一步 还有美国联邦调查局
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1970

不是一次 两次 而是总是
Got past them not once, not twice, but consistently.

1971

就像他们
Almost as if they were on the...

1972

就潜伏在里面
The inside.

1973

你
You.

1974

为神马
Why?

1975

就是这个问题 不是吗
That is the question, isn't it?

1976

你说得对
You're right.

1977

我不能告诉你我等了多久
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1978

就为了看你脸上的表情
to see the look on your face.

1979

你是谁？
Who are you?

1980

你想在我身上要什么
What do you want from me?

1981

我想要什么
What do I want?

1982

我想看你在这个牢房里度过余生
I want you to spend the rest of your life in this cell,

1983

盯着四面墙 反省下你的所作所为
staring at four walls and wondering how you missed it.

1984

是如何因自负而被蒙蔽了双眼
How you let yourself be so blinded by your ego

1985

自以为自己领先了一步
that you convinced yourself that you were one step ahead

1986

事实上你却总是落后两步
when you were always two steps behind.

1987

Dylan？
Dylan?

1988

等一下
Wait a minute.

1989

Dylan 这到底怎么回事
Dylan! How did this happen?

1990

Dylan
Dylan!

1991

为神马？
Why?

1992

为神马？
Why?

1993

哦 上帝
Oh, my God.

1994

不是真的吧
I did not see that coming.

1995

这不科学啊
That's impossible!

1996

不可能啊
No way.

1997

那其实不错
That was actually pretty good.

1998

谢谢
Thank you.

1999

当我说 一定要做房间里最聪明的人
When I said, "Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2000

2006

听着 正经的

2007

我从来都百分百相信魔术
I have always been a 100% believer.

2008

而且我还为此花了不少精力
And the amount of energy I have expended to keep

2009

让这些不信的人去相信
these infidels on point...

2010

Merritt 你可以加入了
Merritt, you're in.

2011

上帝保佑
God bless.

2012

Come.

2013

真正的魔术是让四位强大的个人
The real magic is taking four strong solo acts

2014

组成队且并肩合作
and making them all work together.

2015

而你们正是这样做的
And that's exactly what you did.

2016

欢迎
So welcome.

2017

2026

他们用廉价的钢材

2027

吃回扣

2028

当Shrike下沉到河底的时候 保险箱变形了
When he got to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2029

他被困住了
And he was trapped.

2030

他是你的父亲

2031

演出前的早晨我就觉得有些异样
The morning before the show didn't feel like any other day.

2032

当我父亲说要去工作 他看得出来我不想让他走
When my father said he had to go to work, he could see that I didn't want him to leave.

2033

所以他把他的手表给我 要我一直数着秒针等他回来
So he gave me his watch, and he told me to count the seconds until he came back.

2034

从那个时候起我就没让这手表停过
I have never let his watch stop since then.

2035

从那个时候起

2036

我带起了一副面具
I created a persona.

2037

2038

但是我唯一没有想到会发生的．
But the one thing that I couldn't imagine happening

2039

是你

2040

就是努力解决这个案件
And I know that the logical conclusion for you

2041

解决这个案子是理所当然的
is to take this case to its resolution.

2042

把我供进去也是应该的
And for you to turn me in.

2043

没错 但是你知道我是怎么看待决心和逻辑的
Yeah. But you know how I feel about resolution and logic.

2044
