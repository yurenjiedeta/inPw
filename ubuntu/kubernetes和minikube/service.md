- service

Create a sample deployment and expose it on port 8080:

```shell
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

It may take a moment, but your deployment will soon show up when you run:

```shell
kubectl get services hello-minikube
```

The easiest way to access this service is to let minikube launch a web browser for you:

```shell
minikube service hello-minikube
```

Alternatively, use kubectl to forward the port:

```shell
kubectl port-forward service/hello-minikube 7080:8080
```

Tada! Your application is now available at http://localhost:7080/.

You should be able to see the request metadata in the application output. Try changing the path of the request and observe the changes. Similarly, you can do a POST request and observe the body show up in the output.
