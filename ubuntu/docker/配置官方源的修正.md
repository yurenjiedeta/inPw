This error typically indicates that the connection to the Docker repository server is being refused, which could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network Issues**: There might be a problem with your internet connection or with the server itself.
2. **Firewall or Proxy**: Your network firewall or proxy settings might be blocking the connection.
3. **Docker Server Issue**: The Docker server might be temporarily down or experiencing issues.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Your Internet Connection**: Ensure that your internet connection is working properly.
   
2. **Ping the Server**: Try pinging the Docker repository server to see if it is reachable:
   ```bash
   ping download.docker.com
   ```

3. **Check Firewall and Proxy Settings**:
   - If you're behind a firewall, make sure it allows outbound connections on port 443.
   - If you use a proxy, make sure your proxy settings are correctly configured.

4. **Update Your System**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. **Try Curl with a Different URL**: Test curl with another secure website to check if the issue is specific to Docker's server:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://www.google.com
   ```

6. **Check Docker's Status**: Verify if there are any reported issues with Docker's servers by checking their status page or official forums.

7. **Configure Docker Repository Manually**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install \
       apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates \
       curl \
       gnupg \
       lsb-release

   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

   sudo apt-get update
   ```

Try these steps and let me know if the issue persists.
